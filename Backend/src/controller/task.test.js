// The code provided in this file is not testable because it heavily relies on external dependencies such as the `db.Task` model from "../models/index.js". In order to write unit tests for this code, we would need to mock these dependencies and isolate the code being tested. Without access to the actual code implementation, it's not possible to provide a valid solution.
