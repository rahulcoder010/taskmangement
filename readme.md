# JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used for client-side web development. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web along with HTML and CSS.

JavaScript allows web developers to add interactivity, dynamic elements, and behavior to web pages. It is commonly used for tasks such as form validation, DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX requests.

JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers and can also be used on the server-side with the help of server-side platforms like Node.js.
