## Machine Learning Prediction Module

This module provides an implementation of various machine learning algorithms for prediction tasks. It includes algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. These algorithms can be used to make predictions based on historical data, such as predicting housing prices, classifying emails as spam or not spam, or predicting the likelihood of a customer churn.

The module also provides tools for data preprocessing, feature selection, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. It supports both supervised learning and unsupervised learning tasks. Supervised learning tasks involve predicting a target variable based on a set of input features, while unsupervised learning tasks involve finding patterns or structures in the data without a specified target variable.

The machine learning models in this module are trained using labeled data, where the input features are associated with known target values. These models can then be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. The module provides functions to train, test, and evaluate these models, as well as to save and load trained models for future use.

Overall, this machine learning prediction module is a versatile tool for building and deploying prediction models in various domains, ranging from finance and marketing to healthcare and computer vision. It empowers data scientists and machine learning practitioners to develop accurate and reliable prediction models that can drive data-driven decision making and provide valuable insights.
