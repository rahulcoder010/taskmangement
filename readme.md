# Javascript

Javascript is a popular programming language for building web applications. It is often used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites.

```javascript
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

Javascript can be embedded directly into HTML documents using `<script>` tags, or it can be stored in separate external files and included in the HTML using the `src` attribute of the `<script>` tag.

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

Javascript supports a wide range of functionalities, including manipulating HTML elements, handling user events, making HTTP requests, and interacting with databases. It also has various libraries and frameworks that make development faster and easier, such as React, Angular, and jQuery.

```javascript
const button = document.querySelector("#myButton");
button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});
```

Overall, Javascript is a versatile language that plays a crucial role in modern web development. It allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications that enhance the user experience.
