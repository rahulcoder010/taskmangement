1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/example/task-management.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd task-management`
3. Install the dependencies for the front-end: `cd frontend && npm install`
4. Install the dependencies for the back-end: `cd ../backend && npm install`

### Usage

To start the application, follow these steps:

1. Start the back-end server:
```shell
cd backend
npm start
```

2. Start the front-end server:
```shell
cd frontend
npm start
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the task management application.
