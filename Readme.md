# Machine Learning Prediction Module

The Machine Learning Prediction module is a component that provides the functionality to make predictions using trained machine learning models. It takes input data and applies the trained model to generate predictions or forecasts.

The module supports various types of machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks. It can handle both classification and regression tasks.

To use the Machine Learning Prediction module, you need to provide the trained model and the input data. The input data should be formatted according to the requirements of the specific model. The module will then utilize the model to make predictions on the input data.

The predictions generated by the module can be used for various purposes, such as forecasting sales, predicting customer behavior, or detecting anomalies. The accuracy of the predictions depends on the quality of the trained model and the suitability of the input data.

The Machine Learning Prediction module offers a flexible and scalable solution for incorporating machine learning predictions into your applications. It provides an interface to easily integrate with other modules or systems, allowing you to leverage the power of machine learning in your applications.
