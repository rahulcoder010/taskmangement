#### Machine Learning Prediction Module

This module is designed to perform machine learning predictions using various algorithms. It provides a flexible and easy-to-use interface for training and predicting with different models.

#### Usage

To use this module, simply import it into your project and create an instance of the `PredictionModel` class. Then, you can train the model using the `train` method and make predictions using the `predict` method.

```python
from prediction_module import PredictionModel

# Create an instance of the PredictionModel class
model = PredictionModel()

# Train the model using training data
model.train(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
```

Note: Replace `X_train`, `y_train`, `X_test`, and `y_test` with your actual training and testing data.

#### Supported Algorithms

This module supports various machine learning algorithms, including:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines

To use a specific algorithm, pass the corresponding algorithm name as an argument when creating an instance of the `PredictionModel` class. For example:

```python
# Create an instance of the PredictionModel class with Logistic Regression algorithm
model = PredictionModel(algorithm='Logistic Regression')
```

Available algorithms: 'Linear Regression', 'Logistic Regression', 'Decision Tree', 'Random Forest', 'Support Vector Machines'

#### Customization

You can customize the behavior of the prediction module by modifying the configuration parameters. The `PredictionModel` class provides several optional parameters that allow you to control the training and prediction process. 

For example, you can adjust the hyperparameters of the machine learning algorithm by passing a `hyperparameters` dictionary to the `train` method:

```python
# Define hyperparameters for the algorithm
hyperparameters = {'max_depth': 5, 'learning_rate': 0.1}

# Train the model with custom hyperparameters
model.train(X_train, y_train, hyperparameters=hyperparameters)
```

You can also enable feature scaling or normalization by setting the `scaled_features` parameter to `True`:

```python
# Enable feature scaling
model = PredictionModel(scaled_features=True)
```

#### Error Handling

This module includes error handling to provide informative error messages in case of invalid input or unexpected errors. If any error occurs during training or prediction, the module will raise a specific exception with a descriptive error message.

For example, if the input data is not in the expected format, the `InvalidDataError` exception will be raised:

```python
try:
    # Train the model
    model.train(X_train, y_train)
except InvalidDataError as e:
    print(f'Invalid data: {str(e)}')
```

#### Limitations

This module has the following limitations:

- It supports only tabular data with numerical features.
- It does not handle missing values in the input data.
- It does not support feature engineering or automatic feature selection.

#### Dependencies

This module requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7+
- scikit-learn 0.24.2
- numpy 1.21.2
- pandas 1.3.3
```
