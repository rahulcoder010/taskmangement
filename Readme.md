# Machine Learning Prediction Module

This module contains the code for training and predicting using a machine learning model.

## How to Use

1. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Train the model using the `train.py` script:
```shell
python train.py
```

3. After the model is trained, use the `predict.py` script to make predictions:
```shell
python predict.py --input_file data.csv --output_file predictions.csv
```

4. The predictions will be saved in the `predictions.csv` file.

## Model Details

The machine learning model used in this module is a Random Forest classifier. It has been trained on a labeled dataset and can predict the target variable based on the input features.

The model has been trained using the scikit-learn library, which provides a high-level interface for implementing machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is stored in the `data.csv` file. It contains both the input features and the corresponding target variable.

## Performance Evaluation

The performance of the model can be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This information can be obtained by running the `evaluate.py` script.

## Future Improvements

- Add more features to the dataset to improve the predictive power of the model.
- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms to find the one that yields the best results.
- Use cross-validation techniques to get a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.

## Conclusion

The machine learning prediction module provides a convenient way to train and predict using a machine learning model. With further improvements and experimentation, the accuracy and reliability of the predictions can be enhanced.
