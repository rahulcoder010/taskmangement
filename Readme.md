# Machine Learning Prediction module

This module provides functions and classes for creating and training machine learning models for making predictions. It includes various algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.

The module supports both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. It provides tools for data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation. It also allows for saving and loading trained models, as well as making predictions based on new input data.

With this module, users can easily build and deploy predictive models for a wide range of applications, such as predicting stock prices, classifying emails, or detecting fraud.

Example usage:

```python
from ml_prediction import LinearRegression

# Load training data
X_train, y_train = load_data('train.csv')

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Save the trained model
model.save('model.pkl')

# Load the saved model
model = LinearRegression()
model.load('model.pkl')

# Make predictions for new data
X_test = load_data('test.csv')
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
```

Overall, the Machine Learning Prediction module simplifies the process of developing and deploying machine learning models, making it accessible to both experts and beginners in the field.
